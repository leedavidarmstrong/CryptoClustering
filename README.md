Crypto Clustering
Overview
Crypto Clustering is a Python project utilizing unsupervised machine learning techniques to analyze and cluster cryptocurrencies based on their price changes over 24-hour and 7-day periods. This project aims to uncover underlying patterns in cryptocurrency market movements and group similar behaving cryptos together.

Features
Data Exploration: Analyze cryptocurrency market data for insights.
Data Normalization: Utilize StandardScaler from scikit-learn for data preprocessing.
K-Means Clustering: Implement K-Means algorithm to cluster cryptocurrencies.
Elbow Method: Determine the optimal number of clusters.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Reduce dimensionality of the dataset.
Data Visualization: Visualize clusters using hvPlot.
